[Legacy Family Tree](https://legacyfamilytree.com/) This is great for plugging into  Family Search as it is one the few authorized applications allowed to pull history and hierarchy from Family Search.  I used it to go back 60 generation (which implies up to 60 ^ 4 = 12,960,000 direct ancestors assuming that no one was ever lost).  I ended up with about 132,000 ancestors for myself and my wife which took over 30 hours to gather.

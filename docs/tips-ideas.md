# Age warnings - Yellow tag
When you see people in your lineage with yellow, it means they did not pass the ages tests.  This includes the following:
- As a [Mother](https://www.oldest.org/people/mothers/) they are too old or young or negative
- As a [Father](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-father-) they are too old or young or negative
- As a [person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_verified_oldest_people) they are too old or young or negative

See [GedcomParser.py](../gedcom-to-map/gedcom/GedcomParser.py) for age range variables.
